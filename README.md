## 🚀 What Makes Us Different?

**Secure Salary Stream** is the world's first payroll system that combines **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** with blockchain technology to create a truly private yet transparent salary management platform.

### 🎯 Core Innovation

- **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Salary Processing**: Your salary data is encrypted even during computation
- **⛓️ Blockchain Immutability**: All transactions are recorded on-chain for auditability
- **🎭 Privacy by Design**: No one can see your salary amount, not even the system administrators
- **🌐 Multi-Wallet Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with 20+ Web3 wallets
